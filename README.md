Trading-App

Welcome to the Trading App! This C++ application provides real-time stock trading insights by fetching data from the Twelve Data API and applying a sophisticated Volume Climax Indicator (VCI) strategy. It helps users make informed decisions on buying and selling stocks by generating signals based on volume spikes and price breakouts, with built-in trade management features like stop-loss, take-profit, and partial exits.

The app integrates a Pine Script-inspired strategy originally developed for TradingView, adapted for real-time execution in C++. This project was developed by Mahesh Hire as of September 11, 2024.

Purpose of Implementation

The Trading App aims to empower users with a powerful tool for real-time stock trading decisions. It combines real-time data monitoring with a volume-based trading strategy to provide actionable buy/sell signals while managing risk through stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms.

Features





Real-Time Data Monitoring: Continuously fetches stock prices and volume data using the Twelve Data API.



Volume Climax Indicator (VCI) Strategy: Identifies high-volume bars to set key price levels (LOW and HIGH) for signal generation.



Buy/Sell Signal Generation: Generates buy signals when the price breaks above the HIGH of a high-volume bar, with confirmation logic to reduce false signals.



Trade Management:





Stop-loss set at 1% below the LOW.



Take-profit set at 2x the stop-loss distance above the HIGH.



Partial exit of 50% of the position at an intermediate profit level.



Profit/Loss Calculation: Displays the percentage profit or loss based on the day‚Äôs open and close prices.



Cost Calculation: Allows users to calculate the cost of buying/selling a specified amount of stock.



Alerts: Prints actionable alerts to the console for buy signals, confirmed entries, partial exits, and stop-loss hits.

Project Implementation

Project Structure

The project is organized into several files, each serving a specific purpose:





curl_functions.hpp and curl_functions.cpp: Handle HTTP requests to the Twelve Data API.





get_price(): Fetches the current stock price.



get_stock_quote(): Retrieves detailed stock data (open, high, low, close, volume).



get_historical_data(): Fetches historical data for volume analysis.



functions.hpp and functions.cpp: Contain the core trading logic.





ProfitLoss(): Calculates and displays profit/loss percentage.



wantTransact(): Manages user interaction for buying/selling and cost calculation.



print_data(): Displays stock data.



calculate_mean() and calculate_stddev(): Compute volume metrics for VCI analysis.



update_trading_state(): Identifies high-volume bars and sets key levels (LOW, HIGH, SL, TP).



execute_trading_strategy(): Executes the VCI-based trading strategy (buy/sell signals, trade management).



main.cpp: The main entry point, orchestrating data fetching, strategy execution, and user interaction.



config.json: Stores the API key for Twelve Data API access (not tracked in git).



.gitignore: Excludes compiled files and sensitive data (e.g., config.json).



compile-and-run.sh: A script to simplify compilation and execution.

Built With





C++ STL (Standard Template Library): For core programming logic.



libcurl: For making HTTP requests to the Twelve Data API.



JsonCpp: For parsing JSON responses from the API.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Before running the Trading App, ensure you have the following installed:





C++ Compiler (g++): For compiling the code.



libcurl: For HTTP requests.





Install on Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev



JsonCpp: For JSON parsing.





Install on Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev



Twelve Data API Key: Sign up at Twelve Data to obtain an API key.

Installation





Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/maheshbhire/trading-app-in-cpp.git



Navigate to the project directory:

cd trading-app-in-cpp



Create a config.json file in the project root with your API key:

{
    "api_key": "your_twelve_data_api_key_here"
}



Compile the application:

g++ -o output/trade main.cpp curl_functions.cpp functions.cpp -lcurl -ljsoncpp

Or use the provided script:

./compile-and-run.sh

Usage





Run the compiled application:

./output/trade



Enter the ticker symbol of a company (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.) when prompted.



The app will:





Fetch real-time stock data and historical data for volume analysis.



Display stock details (price, volume, etc.) and profit/loss percentage.



Generate buy/sell signals based on the VCI strategy.



Manage trades with stop-loss, take-profit, and partial exits.



Print alerts for trading actions (buy, sell, partial exit, stop-loss hit).



The app updates every 3 seconds, providing continuous real-time insights.
